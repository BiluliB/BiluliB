I'm from Basel, Switzerland, training to become an application developer. I love to learn new things and explore different subjects.

I am always curious and enjoy gaining new skills. I am passionate about finding innovative solutions to challenges and expanding my knowledge every day.Most of the projects you see here are school projects.

Join me on my journey of learning and discovery!
